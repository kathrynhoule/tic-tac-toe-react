# tic-tac-toe-react

## What is this project?
This project is intended to be a simple game of tic tac toe that can be played with two players (an X and an O) in person. In the future, I would ideally like to add an option for playing against the computer, so that players aren't required to have another person with them in order to enjoy the application.

## Dependencies
This project currently utilizes node, react, and vite. In the future, more dependencies may be added.

## How to run this app
After installing the dependencies, you can run this project using `npm run dev` (for development) or simply `npm run start`.
